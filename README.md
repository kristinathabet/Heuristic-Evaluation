# Heuristic Evaluation: New York Government Websites
# Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation
### Kristina Thabet / DH 110 / Fall 2021
## About the Project 
As society becomes more technology focused, it is important to make sure users are able to interact with websites in an efficent and easy manner. Although teachnological advances has made information widely accessible, it has unfortunately left older indivuduals confused because they are less skilled at interacting with websites. Heuristic evaluations are neccessary to ensure that websites are user friendly for all ages. Even small details such as placement of tabs or picture size can affect the experience users have with the website. For this assignment, I will be analyzing the New York Drivers License Website as well as the New York Housing Services Page to assess how to improve user experience and website functionality. I hope to demonstrate how to improve the New York Drivers License website and the New York Housing Services website for not only the elderly, but every individual.

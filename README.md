# Heuristic Evaluation: New York Government Websites
# Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation
### Kristina Thabet / DH 110 / Fall 2021
## About the Project 
As society becomes more technology focused, it is important to make sure users are able to interact with websites in an efficent and easy manner. Although teachnological advances has made information widely accessible, it has unfortunately left older indivuduals confused because they are less skilled at interacting with websites. Heuristic evaluations are neccessary to ensure that websites are user friendly for all ages. Even small details such as placement of tabs or picture size can affect the experience users have with the website. For this assignment, I will be analyzing the New York Drivers License Website as well as the New York Housing Services Page to assess how to improve user experience and website functionality. I hope to demonstrate how to improve the New York Drivers License website and the New York Housing Services website for not only the elderly, but every individual.  

# [Jakob Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) 


#### 1- Visibility of System Status
The design of the website should keep users informed about wesite status and provide feedback in a resonable time frame. An example of this would be "You Are Here" indicators on directories. 
#### 2- Match Between System and the Real World
The design should be in the same language as the users and have understandable jargon. Ther information should appear natural and in tune with words used in the real world.
#### 3- User Control and Freedom
Users need to be able to easily exit when they perform an unwanted task.
#### 4- Consistency and Standards
Words, situations, and actions should all be kept consistent to reduce user confusion. An example of this would be how hotel check in is always at the front of the hotel. Users appreciate consistency. 
#### 5- Error Prevention
Eliminate error- prone conditons or allow users to confirm before they make an error prone action. Make sure error messages are clear if error is not prevented. 
#### 6- Recognition Rather Than Recall
Make users life easier by making as many options as possible visible so users do not how to memorize how to complete actions. 
#### 7- Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
Have shortcuts in the design to tailor to both advanced users and novice users. Allow users to tailor the actions made on the website. 
#### 8- Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
Leave out irrelevant information on the interface. 
#### 9- Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover From Errors
Have very clear error messages in plain language that tells users what to do to recover from an error. 
#### 10- Help and Documentation 
Have help and documentation easily searchable so users can reach out for extra help if needed.

# Severity Ratings for Usability Problems
The following rating scale will be used to assess the severity of usability problems for both websites below. 
#### Rating 1: 
Mostly cosmetic issues. These issues only needs to be fixed is time allows.
#### Rating 2:
Minor usablilty issues. There are important but not crucial.
#### Rating 3: 
Major usablilty issues. These issues should be first priority. 


# Website 1: [New York State Driver License Website](https://dmv.ny.gov/driver-licenses)
## About 
The New York DMV Website is where users can renew, replace, make changes to, and get a license. This website also handles all registration for vehicles as well as permits, ID's, and more. On the website, you can also find all information and contacts pertaining to the Department of Motor Vehicles. This website serves the public by licensing drivers, securing identities, and regualting the vehicle industry. My goal is to improve user's experience of navigating this important website by providing a heuristic evaluation.

## Intitial Overall Heuristic Evaluation
Before digging deeply, the New York State Driver License website came off boring, bare, and spread out. There are no photos on the website and the only colors used are blue, white, and black. When users move the cursor over a tab, the tab does not react at all, potentially making users feel like the website is unresponsive to the cursor. On a positive note, all large driver license related needs are layed out and easy to read on the opening page of the website. There is an easily accessible search tab as well as an "Ask a Question" feature on the bottom. See below for a deeper heuristic evaluation.

# Heuristic Evalation
#### 1- Visibility of System Status
When something is searched for in the seach bar, the query is not saved, making it difficut for the user to revisit past subtabs on the website. As you type on the search bar, commonly searched options do not pop up, making users question whether or not the website is resonive to their actions. When users move the cursor over different links and tabs, nothing changes at all, also raising questions about the websites responsiveness. I would recommend making tabs and links change colors when the cursor is placed on them, alerting the users that there is more information to be found in that location. I would also add a component on the page that has a moving image or icon. This would confirm the website is on and running to users. (Severity:2)

#### 2- Match Between System and the Real World
Although this is a small issue, the search bar has "Search DMV" written in it to tell users what the bar is for. My recommendation would be to write something more friendly such as "Find What You Need Here," to make users feel like the website is working with them and not against them. The paperwork and regestration done through the DMV is generally annoying and frusturating to drivers. Making this experience more helpful and personal would improve this heuristic. (Severity:1)
#### 3- User Control and Freedom
When users search in the search bar, their previous searches are erased. If the users search did not generate the anwser they needed, they need to retype their search with its new modifications. I recommend that all recent searchs remain in the drop down tab so it is easy for users to quicky search variations of the same phrase in order to anwser their question. There is also no 'Go back' button present on the website. If a user wants to go back to the previous interface, they either need to hit the back button on the Google/Safari application or scroll all the wat down to the bottom of the page to view all menu options again. A 'Go Back' button that remains at the top of the website page would be very useful. (Severity:1)
#### 4- Consistency and Standards
This website stays consistent with the words and phrasing it uses. All links and external pages are navigated the same way. The top of the page has five of the main DMV options on it, as well as drop down menus for each of these options. These tabs never move and can guide users to revisit any part of the website they were on before. This website succeeds in this area. (No Severity0
#### 5- Error Prevention
This website does a good job at preventing errors because it does not let you submit any information that does not match with the websites records. When users attempt to log into the DMV website with an inncorrect login, the sign in doesnt go through and a message ios presented in red ink. "You have entered an invalid Username or Password. If you have forgotten your password, please use this NY.gov ID Forgot Password Self Service link. The Password field is case sensitive and must match your last known password." The website efficiently tells users what is wrong and gives multiple ways they can attempt to make changes to their previous submission. Users can click on all tabs on the website without getting an error message, unless thier personal information was imputted wrong. (No Severity) 
#### 6- Recognition Rather Than Recall
If you click on a tab that gives users instructions on how to do something (for example: get a license), you will find all the steps listed. There is no way for the user to take note of the steps that were completed and what still needs to be done. For users who are filling out paperwork and interacting with the website for multiple days on the same task, it would be helpful to check the boxes of what's completed so they are not forced to rely on their memory. In addition, there are many downloadable forms available on the website becuase paperwork can be submitted in person at local DMV's. The website does not tell you what forms have already been downloaded and clicked on, making users unsure if they filled out all the necessary forms. I wouldgive this issue some priority sincd DMV's are very strict about having all documents ready and filled out correctly. I would recommend a check box by every sep and downloadable file that users can click themselves when they complete it.  (Severity:2)
#### 7- Flexibility and Efficiency of Use	
This site is fairly easy to navigate, yet I do not see any shortcuts in the design for more advanced users. There is not much tailoring users can do to the website, which makes sense because the website is mostly just informative. (No Severity)
#### 8- Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
Since the New York Driver License website holds a lot of information, it can be difficult to consolidate it all in just a few tabs. Towards the bottom of the website, there is so much scrolling to do and not a lot of information presented. This website page would be less overwhelming to users if it was shorter and had better use of space. The information is presented in one long colum with each link spaced out from each other. I recommend creating three columns to decrease the length of the interface and make the website look less overwhelming than it actually is. It would also be much more visually pleasing this way and motivate users to be less reluctant to use the website. (Severity:2)
#### 9- Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover From Errors
The error messages provided by this website are very clear, easy to understand, and informative. When a mistake is made on the login, it informs users what to check for and how to recover their account if they forgot their login. When users sign up to make a new account the website has red astrics on the necessary feilds of information. When users go to submit their sign up form and there is an error somewhere on the page, the website does not say which field has an error. This leaves users confused as to where they made a mistake and decreases users motivation to log in again. To improve this webisite, error messages should pop up exactly where the error occured, not at the top of the page. (Severity:3)
#### 10- Help and Documentation 
Generally when users are on a help tab, they are looking for personalized help tailored to a specific question. On the New York Driver License page, the only ways to get help are to contact the DMV through the "Ask a Question" feature, which is inaccurate and only provides information found elsewhere on the page. On the contact us tab, the only helpful information is to call the DMV which usually has a long wait time. I would recommend a separate help tab that contains contact information as well as commonly asked questions and anwsers. (Severity:3)

# Website 2: [New York State Housing Services Website](https://www.ny.gov/services/housing)
## About 
The New York Housing Services website is where New York residences can find government assistance for housing. These services range from emergency rental assistance, heating and cooling assistance, disaster recover and aid for both renters and owners. Many residents of New York rely on government aided housing services to live safely and stay afloat. My goal is to suggest improvements of the New York
